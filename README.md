# LLaMA
This is the implementation of the paper [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971). 
The code has been written in Python, so make the necessary changes to the scripts to run them.
Thanks to [Umar Jamilai](https://www.youtube.com/@umarjamilai) and his videos on the topic, they were extremely helpful and valuable.

More comments will be added in the future to make the process of understanding the code easier.

I have used the opus_books dataset for this code.
